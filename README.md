#  Using Deep Learning to find evidence of extra-terrestrial life using SETI Big Data

Berkeley SETI Research Center has made data from 3 radio telescopes publicly available to be viewed and analysed. Their aim is to sift through the data in order to find evidence of signals from extra-terrestrial life, but this data is very large. Artificial Neural Networks are a collection of  'neurons' which collect signal inputs from a previous layer of neurons; with enough layers they can learn to classify data. TensorFlow is a python library created by the Google Brain Team for using these neural networks, it has extensive documentation and is used for many business and scientific projects. This project would involve creating, testing and eventually applying a deep neural network to SETI's telescope data to find candidates for signals created by extra-terrestrial life or other particular targets of interest. The bulk of it would be written in Python, using the TensorFlow, Astropy, Numpy libraries.
